Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n              to, the following:\n              1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n                 and translate a Work;\n              2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n              3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\u2019s image or likeness\n                 depicted in a Work;\n              4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n                 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n              5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n                 a Work;\n              6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n                 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n                 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n                 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n              7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n                 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n                 thereof.\n         \n           2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n              applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n              unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\u2019s Copyright\n              and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n              known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n              action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n              duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cWaiver\u201d). Affirmer\n              makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n              to the detriment of Affirmer\u2019s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n              such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n              termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n              enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\u2019s express\n              Statement of Purpose.\n         \n           3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n              judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n              shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n              Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n              Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n              royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n              irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\u2019s Copyright and\n              Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n              maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cLicense\u201d). The License\n              shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n              Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n              invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n              ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n              such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n              of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n              assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n              in either case contrary to Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose.\n         \n           4.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n                 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n                 limitation any person\u2019s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n                 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n                 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n              4.
